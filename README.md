Senior full-stack / backend engineer with **15+ years** of experience building and operating **scalable, distributed systems**—from product features to platform APIs, integrations, and cloud infrastructure.

## Quick context
- **On GitHub since 2010** (original account). Lost access in **2021**.
- **Current GitHub account active since 2022**.
- Most production work lives in **client/company organization repositories** and can’t be transferred to a personal GitHub due to confidentiality/IP.

This profile is mainly for **personal projects, prototypes, experiments, and algorithm practice**.

## What I build
- **Backend & platform services:** APIs, integrations, microservices, event-driven systems
- **Cloud-native systems:** serverless and containerized workloads, reliability and cost efficiency
- **Applied AI / GenAI features:** turning ML/LLM capabilities into product functionality (pipelines, evaluation, monitoring, and safe deployment)
- **GenAI agent systems:** agent architecture/development, **RAG**, tool use, and integration patterns (including **MCP**)
- **Data & ML solutions:** pipelines, experimentation-to-production workflows, model integration, automation
- **Frontend apps:** Angular/React/TypeScript UIs for internal tools and product surfaces

## Skills snapshot
**Languages**
- TypeScript/Node.js, Java, Python, C/C++

**Frontend**
- Angular, React, HTML, SCSS

**Backend / Architecture**
- Distributed systems, microservices, serverless
- APIs & integrations, async processing, resiliency patterns

**Databases & Data**
- PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle
- OLTP & OLAP fundamentals, pragmatic data modeling

**Cloud**
- AWS, Azure, GCP

**DevOps / Platform**
- Docker, **Kubernetes**, **Terraform**
- CI/CD, automation, release hygiene

**Applied AI / MLOps / GenAI**
- Building AI-powered features end-to-end: data prep → training/finetuning → serving/inference → monitoring
- Model experimentation, evaluation mindset, productionization basics
- **GenAI agent architecture**: routing, memory, tool use, safety/guardrails, and observability
- **RAG**: document ingestion, chunking, embeddings, retrieval evaluation, citation-style responses
- Tooling/integration patterns including **MCP**
- TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn

**Engineering fundamentals**
- Algorithms & data structures, correctness, edge cases, complexity analysis

---

## How I like to work
- **Clarity first:** well-defined interfaces, readable code, documented decisions
- **Pragmatic quality:** tests where they pay off (unit/integration), maintainable structure
- **Reliability mindset:** failure modes, observability, “operate what you build”
- **Performance-aware:** measure, profile, and optimize based on evidence

---

## Current focus
- Publishing focused projects with clear documentation, automated tests, CI pipelines, and maintainable architecture patterns.
- Keeping skills sharp with **algorithm practice** and **system design**
- Cloud and platform tooling (IaC, k8s patterns), plus ML/GenAI experiments

### Notes
Public contribution history doesn’t represent all professional activity—much of it is in private organization repositories.
