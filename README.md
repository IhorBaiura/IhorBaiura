Senior full-stack / backend engineer with **15+ years** of experience building and operating **scalable, distributed systems**—from product features to platform APIs, integrations, and cloud infrastructure 🚀

## Quick context 🧭
- 🗓️ **On GitHub since 2010** (original account). Lost access in **2021**.
- ✅ **Current GitHub account active since 2022**.
- 🔒 Most production work lives in **client/company organization repositories** and can’t be transferred to a personal GitHub due to confidentiality/IP.

This profile is mainly for **personal projects, prototypes, experiments, and algorithm practice** 🧪📚

## What I build 🛠️
- 🧩 **Backend & platform services:** APIs, integrations, microservices, event-driven systems
- ☁️ **Cloud-native systems:** serverless and containerized workloads, reliability and cost efficiency
- 🤖 **Applied AI / GenAI features:** turning ML/LLM capabilities into product functionality (pipelines, evaluation, monitoring, and safe deployment)
- 🧠 **GenAI agent systems:** agent architecture/development, **RAG**, tool use, and integration patterns (including **MCP**)
- 📊 **Data & ML solutions:** pipelines, experimentation-to-production workflows, model integration, automation
- 🖥️ **Frontend apps:** Angular/React/TypeScript UIs for internal tools and product surfaces
